# skiPosts

I took this project on to learn Ruby on Rails. The idea for the application is simple: users can make posts about certain ski routes they went on at Winter Park Resort. This can help people get an understanding for how well people like/dislike certain ski routes. I decided to decouple the frontend and backend, using axios in React to communicate. Postgres is the database with three classes so far: Users, Posts, and Ski_Routes. This is a work in progress but the following are some implementation plans:

# TODO:

1. Make a way for users to create an account/login
2. Spiffy up the UI and make it nice
3. Use a weather API to display the current weather at Winter Park
4. Turn the mountain map into a graph representation (be able to return paths of routes that can be taken down the mountain)
5. Add a navigation bar
